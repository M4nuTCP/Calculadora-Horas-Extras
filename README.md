Overtime Calculator for Workers

This project has been developed with the purpose of enabling workers to autonomously calculate the gross pay for their overtime hours. Its operation is straightforward and efficient: the user enters their job category, the number of overtime hours worked, and the corresponding type of overtime. These details are stored in a calculator located at the bottom of the tool, providing the user with the gross amount based on their job category, overtime type, and total overtime hours.

The rationale behind the calculator's storage function is to provide a solution for workers with different types of overtime. This feature allows users to systematically record and organize accumulated overtime hours for each type, facilitating tracking and obtaining the final sum of gross pay.

In summary, this tool empowers workers to calculate their personalized overtime pay autonomously, ensuring the ability to manage different types of overtime efficiently and accurately. The calculator will store and process information in a way that provides the user with a clear and comprehensive final result.
